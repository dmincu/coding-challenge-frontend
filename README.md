Tried to implement the mocks that can be seen in mockups.

Total time spent: 8h

End result: Not amazing. There's only a very basic list functionality and
no search or filtering.

Things that work:
 - Reactive header bar that calls an extendable menu-drawer
 - API calls to fetch data and parsing that data into needed format that should
 be passed to components
 - Component separation: each component is in it's own class and there's state
 transfer between parents and children
 - Dynamically creating the movie and TV cards
 - Reusable components: same card for movie and TV show

 Things that are missing:
 - Search bar
 - Filter grid
 - Css that would make everything nice

 What went badly: My poor experience with React and JS in general. As much as
 I relied on using existing components, the fact that I never used React before
 and the fact that I don't usually write in JS made this kind of messy and a 
 scramble.

 What went well: I think I managed to learn a lot through this. Managed to set up
 everything. Learnt how to structure components. How to interpret state and how to
 change it and in the end there's some of the functionality there.
