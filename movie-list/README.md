Tried to implement the mocks that can be seen in mockups.

End reuslt: Not amazing. Doesn't have almost any of the functionality.

Things that work:
 - Reactive header bar that calls an extendable menu-drawer
 - API calls to fetch data and parsing that data into needed format that should
 be passed to components
 - Component separation. I think the isolation between components is pretty ok

 Things that are missing:
 - Search bar
 - Filter grid
 - Movie cards
 - Css that would make everything nice

 What went badly: My poor experience with React and JS in general. As much as
 I relied on using existing components, the fact that I never used React before
 and the fact that I don't usually write in JS made this kind of messy and a 
 scramble.

 What went well: I think I managed to learn a lot through this. Managed to set up
 everything. Learnt how to structure components. How to interpret state and how to
 change it.
